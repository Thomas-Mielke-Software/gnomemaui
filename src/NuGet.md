# [GNOME MAUI .NET][GNOMEMAUI]

GnomeMaui is a framework for creating native Linux desktop apps with C# and XAML. Using GnomeMaui, you can develop apps that run on modern Linux distributions from a single shared codebase.

Use SkiaSharp with Microsoft.Maui.Graphics on Linux using GTK4 with Cairo and OpenGL via GirCore bindings.

This package enables drawing with SkiaSharp in Maui.Graphics environments on Linux, using native GTK4 support through GirCore with both CPU (Cairo) and GPU (OpenGL ES) rendering.

Please do not reference this package directly.
